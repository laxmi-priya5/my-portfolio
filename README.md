## Next.js says:

“If you create a file called page.tsx inside any folder → that folder becomes a route (a page).”

🔹 "Folder name = URL"
🔹 "page.tsx = what to show"

# ✅ When to use <a href="#about"> in Next.js

If you are linking to a section on the same page (scrolling), like:

<a href="#about">About</a>

This is perfect and recommended.

Because:

It scrolls to the section in the same page

No page navigation

No need for <Link>

Both React and Next.js support it
